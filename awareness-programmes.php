                        <b>Child protection:</b>
                        <p>It is one of the most unfortunate actions that prevails in our society. Basically it happened in those societies where the light of education is quite negligible and where girl children were nothing but the burden. So the guardians tried to avoid the burden by giving marriage to their child before maturity. Our organization provides awareness camps in various places in the sipajhar block area to abolish the bad practice from  the society by giving proper knowledge through awareness camps. In this society people thought that Girl children were nothing but a burden. We are now happy that our awareness camps help the interior villagers and char areas to stop the early marriage in their society.</p>

                        <b>Sexual abuse:</b>
                        <p>Sexual abuse is one of the most heinous forbidden word in our society. Because the man who is involved in this act is really like an animal. The society where there is no proper education, economic and social development in that area has some illiterate people involved in these forbidden acts. To rescue and avoid this bad action we provided awareness camps in the remote areas of our block area to give the proper knowledge and education, so that the children of these areas were saved & rescued from this heinous work.</p>

                        <p>Regarding the drug addiction we have taken a special measure i.e the children who are coming for therapy to our unit we provide them light food and organized a seminar on Drug Abuse. This type of seminar is observed occasionally to enhance the knowledge of the parents and to give proper guidance of the bad effect of drug abuse to the children & guardian as a whole.</p>
